Xmonad_Config
=============

My Xmonad Config

Just my xmonad and xmobar config with some associated scripts to make the ui more pleasant.
NOTE YOU NEED xmonad-darcs as many of the advanced features of the config file requires it.
I use the following arch repos do get the latest haskell stuff:
[haskell-core]
Server = http://xsounds.org/~haskell/core/$arch
Server = http://kiwilight.com/haskell/$arch

[haskell-web]
Server = http://archhaskell.mynerdside.com/$repo/$arch
